A blown up version of the compact task switcher

This is an updated version of my LargeIconList using the latest code from the compact task switcher. In particular, it correctly updates the size of the dialog box now. 

Other changes over LargeIconList include more vertical spacing so everything doesn't look squished together.

To install: copy the folder list to ~/.local/share/kwin/tabbox/ (which you may need to create)
